# InquirED Full Stack Performance task
Thank you for taking the time to take the Full Stack Performance task. This task will gauge your TypeScript, ReactJS, NodeJS and team support capabilities.

## The App
Our performance task app is a simple grade calculator. Our end users are students on a wide array of devices where they can access and calculate their potential grades.

The App's Original User Stories were the following:

 1. As a student, I can enter my Homework Grade and Assessment Grade
 2. As a student, I should be able to calculate my grade based on my inputted scores
 3. As a student, I should receive a clear grade percentage along with the letter grade assigned to that range.
 4. As a teacher, I should be able to set the percentages for each criteria ( Homework, Assessment )

## The Situation
The Grade calculator has been live for a few years now and students & teachers love the application and use it daily. However, we have gotten significant amount of requests to add a quizzes as a grading criteria. 

We've also noticed a bug in the calculator. When a teacher copy-pastes scores, the scores calculated are coming out incorrectly.

OR checking numbers as truthy/falsy but ignoring 0, Maybe some sort of filter logic fail 
OR what could an edge case be?


Two of our Jr. developers has put in Pull Requests to development with the following changes:

Our Jr. Back End Developer put in the following Description in their PR
"Adds Quiz as a Criteria to the calculation service."

Issues:
- Truthy/Falsy on number 

Our Jr. Front End Developer out in a PR with the following description:
"Adds quiz to score output"

Issues:
- Should forget to validate input

## Your Tasks
As a mid-level engineer, you will be responsible for providing high quality code and solutions. In addition to that, it is our responsibility as a team to help create an environment for growth and development among all levels of engineers. In doing so, we've asked all developers, no matter their level, to participate in Code Reviews.

1. You've been tasked to review and comment on both Pull Requests and make sure the code is clean, readable and tested. You should offer any changes to be made and why.
2. Create and submit a PR to fix the ______ bug.
3. Complete the "Getting Started" README.md 


## Deliverables
1. Have a document ready with the notes and lines of code where the JR developers need to improve or change their work. We will be going over the document on a call and you will drive the pull request review so your notes should reference line # and comments. **DO NOT LEAVE COMMENTS ON THE ACTUAL PR**.
2. Be ready to step with us through a code review of your Pull Request. We will ask you why you did some things, why you didn't. Have a thorough understanding of what your code is doing and why.



## Notes
Please do not spend more than 2 hours on this task. It is more important to us that you can explain your thought process, methodologies and experiences during the work asked. We are not expecting every bug and issue to be completed end-to-end, but it is important that you know and understand the framework.

Good Luck!
