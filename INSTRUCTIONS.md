# InquirED Full Stack Performance task
Thank you for taking the time to take the Full Stack Performance task. This task will gauge your TypeScript, ReactJS, NodeJS and team support capabilities.

## The App
Our performance task app is a simple grade calculator. Our end users are teachers and students on a wide array of devices where they can access and calculate their potential grades.

The App's Original User Stories were the following:

 1. As a student, I can enter my Homework Grade and Assessment Grade
 2. As a student, I should be able to calculate my grade based on my inputted scores
 3. As a student, I should receive a clear grade percentage along with the letter grade assigned to that range.
 4. As a teacher, I should be able to set the percentages for each criteria ( Homework, Assessment )

## The Situation
The Grade calculator has been live for a few years now and students & teachers love the application and use it daily. However, we have gotten significant amount of requests to add a quizzes as a grading criteria. 

Our Jr. Developer titled their PR "Adds Quiz as a Criteria to the calculation service."

Please treat this task as a real-life scenario more than just an assessment.

## Your Tasks
As a mid-level engineer, you will be responsible for providing high quality code and solutions. In addition to that, it is our responsibility as a team to help create an environment for growth and development among all levels of engineers. In doing so, we've asked all developers, no matter their level, to participate in Code Reviews.

1. Fork the repository. Make sure to UNCHECK the "copy main branch only" checkbox.
2. You've been tasked to review and comment on the Pull Request and make sure the code works, is clean, readable and tested. You should offer any changes to be made and why.
3. In your forked repository, add comments to the PR where you would make the changes.
4. Create a copy of the `add_quizzes` branch and name it `add_quizzes_{your_name}`
5. Create a Pull Request from the `add_quizzes_{your_name}` branch to main on the upstream repo

NOTE: In order to show us your notes on the PR, you will either need to come ready with a google doc with line numbers and comments

OR

You can create a NEW PR on YOUR fork from the original `add_quizzes` branch. From there you can annotate the PR using the tools provided by GitHub.

## Deliverables
1. The quiz feature built BY YOU.
2. A pull request to the main branch from your updated code ( with the quiz feature ) and be ready to have a code review of YOUR code.
3. Notes and reasoning on the Jr Dev. PR in the form of a well-documented review. Be sure to be ready to speak on any suggestion you make on the PR. Have a thorough understanding of what changes should be made and why. You should not make a PR to add notes to the Jr. PR. We will go over that on the call.

## Notes
Please do not spend more than 2 hours on this task. It is more important to us that you can explain your thought process, methodologies and experiences during the work asked. We are not expecting every bug and issue to be completed end-to-end, but it is important that you know and understand the framework.

Good Luck!
